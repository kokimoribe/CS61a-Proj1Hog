###About this project:

- **Project date**: 1/27/2013

- **Objective**: To develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog.

- **Outcome**: Successfully developed a working simulator and several strategies for the dice game Hog in Python. The final strategy that was developed maintained a 64.2% win rate against the baseline strategy after testing many runs through the simulator.
	
- **Contribution**: Implemented higher-order functions, experimented with random number generators, and generated ASCII art to represent dice outcomes in the simulator. Carefully planned out algorithms for implementing the simulator and the gameâ€™s strategies and revised code for organization and efficiency.


###How to use:

1. Learn the rules of Hog [hog_rules.txt](hog_rules.txt)
2. 
      - To simulate a single game in which player 0 always wants to roll 5 dice, while player 1 always wants to roll 6 dice, enter the following line into your terminal: ```python3 hog.py -b```
     
     
      - To play an interactive game of Hog against an opponent that always wants to roll 5 dice, enter the following line into your terminal: ```python3 hog.py -p```
      
      - To run a series of strategy experiments, which play many games of Hog and print the average results, enter the following line into your terminal: ```python3 hog.py -r```
      
      - To test the implemented final strategy against the baseline strategy, enter the following line into your terminal: ```python3 hog.py -f```
